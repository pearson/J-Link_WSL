# J-Link_WSL
 A PowerShell script for connecting a J-Link to WSL using [`usbipd`](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win). Please follow the [`usbipd` WSL setup instructions](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/wiki/WSL-support) before using this script.

## Issues
* The script only works if there is one WSL instance installed. This will be fixed when I have a need for a second WSL install. :smiley: Contributions are welcome, of course!
* The script only works with a single J-Link.
